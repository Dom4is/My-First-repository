    <h2><strong>London and Washington have been exercising their control over the Ukrainian negotiators with the aim of
            dragging out the conflict, and this policy has led to the suspension of peace talks between Moscow and Kiev,
            Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on Tuesday.

            Speaking at the New Horizons educational marathon, Lavrov said that Ukraine may have made its own decision
            in Istanbul, when it came up with some “acceptable principles for reaching agreements” during negotiations
            with Russia. However, according to the minister, these ideas were apparently not supported by the West.

            “We have information coming through various channels that Washington and especially London ‘lead’ the
            Ukrainian negotiators and control their freedom of maneuver. They want to drag out the conflict, and it
            seems to them that the longer it will last, the more damage they will inflict on Russian servicemen,” Lavrov
            said.

            The foreign minister doubts, however, that “transferring the conversation to the level of Washington or
            London” would be able to change anything in terms of the progress.
            “Anyway, neither London, nor Washington, nor the West as a whole has put forward any proposals,” Lavrov
            said.

            The West actually acknowledged that Ukraine is “expendable in a hybrid total war against the Russian
            Federation,” Lavrov claimed, citing remarks by the EU, UK and US officials who have said on multiple
            occasions that Russia should not be allowed to win in the Ukrainian conflict.

            “The war was declared by them. And not at all between Ukraine and Russia, but between the West and Russia,”
            Lavrov said.

            Earlier on Tuesday, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said that diplomatic dialogue between Moscow and
            Kiev had been completely suspended after Kiev withdrew from negotiations without providing any response to
            the latest Russian proposals.

            A Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mikhail Podolyak, later confirmed that “after the Istanbul communiqué [in
            March], there have been no changes, no progress.”

            Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms
            of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of
            Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions
            special status within the Ukrainian state.

            The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join
            the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied
            claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.
